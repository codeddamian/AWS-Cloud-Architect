From the Architectural diagrma, I can identify the following problems and the solutions

1. The access to the ports is easily accessible, hence the malicious scripts attempt to login and get the secret recipes was succesful

The solution: To restrict the access to the instance by allowing access to the ports via the Load Balancer only and disable Secure Shell login. 

2. S3 buckets aren't configured  with any encryption to protect from unuthorized users.
The solution: To protect data with KMS service or simply configure the S3-Managed keys for all our recipe vault buckets.
